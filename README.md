Most hotels seek to achieve the highest number of occupied rooms while keeping the process running smoothly. One of the tenacious issues that hotels deal with is the unpredictability of guest cancellations, especially last-minute cancellations. These surprising changes to the original plan cause the revenue that was predicted and resources that were supposed to be used to be free (for example, staff and room inventory) and the problem also arises with the pricing strategy that is flexible. For example, a resort run by a local family might suffer due to multiple abrupt cancellations during the busiest season, when there are empty rooms and some perishable amenities remain unused, thus losing thousands of dollars.

## Business Impact and Importanceüñ•Ô∏è:

Cancellations directly decreasem profitability. Hotels not only come into loss through the room revenue but also the remaining revenues from F&B, spa, and other services are lost because of an empty room. But on the other hand, overbooking to reach a perfect room occupancy level can cut profits when guests find their accommodation already given to others. This is also important when hotels can make most of the operation to be in the position of accurately predicting cancellations in order to:

1. Balance the overbooking, who wishes to maintain the carrier's occupancy rates and customer satisfaction, so as to decrease room prices.
2. Initiate limited-time campaign (For Example, last-minute discounts) to reallocate at-risk inventory.
3. Make scheduling or procurement changes in case of a staff shortage or excess (bedding, food, etc.) to smoothly meet occupancy estimates.
4. Enhance guest experience by fixing overbooking problems and fulfilling upgrades for loyal customers.

## Data Collection Strategyüîç: Relevant data can be gathered from :

üî∏Booking Systems: Survey the reservation information, such as booking duration, room type, meal plans, and costs.  
üî∏Clientele Profiles: Base your decision on past behaviors criminal record, drug addiction, and being a regular customer).  
üî∏Market Trends: Use seasonal fluctuations and local events that are associated with the cancellation behavior as the driver of the analysis.  
üî∏Payment Records: The deposit amounts and payment methods need to be reviewed since there is a very low chance of a booking being canceled if it is prepaid.

## Machine Learning Formulation:

### This problem can be framed as a binary classification task:  
‚úÖ Target Variable: Binary flag denoting whether a booking was canceled (1) or not (0).  
‚úÖ Features: Predictive variables such as lead time (days from booking to stay), price fluctuations, room type, seasonal indicators (e.g., holiday periods), and guest-specific signals (e.g., special requests).  
‚úÖ Goal: Make a model that foretells the odds of a booking where it will be, so the measures can be taken in advance.
